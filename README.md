# "Hot hand" probability analysis

There's a paper ["Surprised by the Gambler's and Hot Hand Fallacies? A
Truth in the Law of Small
Numbers"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2627354)
going around about counterintuitive probability effects. There are
[blog
articles](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/07/09/hey-guess-what-there-really-is-a-hot-hand/)
and [Twitter
posts](https://twitter.com/littmath/status/1769408478139785497) about
it, but people have been a bit rubbish about getting at the intuition
behind it. So, that's what I'm trying to do here.

My intuition is that you can't push a division through an expectation!
This is not very clear, either, so I shall try to clarify.
